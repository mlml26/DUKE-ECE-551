Doing some basic sanity checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm cyoa-step1 *~ *.o
Makefile:11: recipe for target 'clean' failed
g++ -ggdb3 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu++11 -c function.cpp
g++ -ggdb3 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu++11 -c page.cpp
g++ -ggdb3 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu++11 -c cyoa-step1.cpp
g++ -ggdb3 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu++11 -o cyoa-step1  function.o  page.o  cyoa-step1.o
Testing ./cyoa-step1 story1/page1.txt 
Line_22_did_not_match
Your file did not match the expected ouput
Testing ./cyoa-step1 story1/page8.txt 
Your file matched the expected output
Testing ./cyoa-step1 story1/page11.txt 
Your file matched the expected output

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm cyoa-step1 *~ *.o
Makefile:11: recipe for target 'clean' failed
The code did not compile!

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
rm cyoa-step1 *~ *.o
Makefile:11: recipe for target 'clean' failed
The code did not compile!

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
rm cyoa-step1 *~ *.o
Makefile:11: recipe for target 'clean' failed
The code did not compile!

Step 1: FAILED
Step 2: FAILED
Step 3: FAILED
Step 4: FAILED

You have NOT passed the pregrader's test cases.
You should go back and debug the indicated step(s).
